Ansible basics -
- Control Node: The machine where Ansible is installed and from which automation commands are run.
  It manages the automation tasks and communicates with the managed nodes.

- Managed Node: The remote machine (or group of machines) that Ansible manages.
  These nodes are the ones on which tasks are executed, and they donâ€™t need Ansible installed,
  as Ansible uses SSH or WinRM to communicate with them.

- Playbook: A YAML file that contains a list of "plays." Playbooks define the tasks that need to be
  executed on the managed nodes and provide an organized way to describe automation processes.

- Play: A single unit of work in a playbook. It is a mapping between a group of managed nodes and a
  series of tasks. A play describes which nodes should be targeted and what actions to perform on them.

- Task: A specific action or command that is performed on the managed nodes. Tasks are the smallest
  unit of work in a play, and they use Ansible modules to accomplish their goals, like installing
  packages or configuring settings.


gather_facts attribute : collects information about target device when 
executing a play and this information can be used later. It can be toggled off.
